# Portfolio

This is my portfolio. 

In the beginning I designed the website with Adobe XD and took the SVG code of several elements from XD to place them in my HTML code.
With this project I've learned to do animations with gsap and I've recaped the process of HTML coding, CSS styling and making a contact formula.
